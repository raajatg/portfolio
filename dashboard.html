                        <p>Large organizations like Adidas often have common end-goals among employees, but can face significant challenges in delivering on those goals because the varying perspectives and skillsets of employees clash with, instead of complementing, one another.</p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">My Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>The “Imposible is Nothing” dashboard creates common ground and understanding between three key personas as they seek to improve the performance of Adidas’s fashion sneakers segment. It does so by identifying the key goals and commonalities that these personas have, and using those as an anchor point to provide a multi-variate lens on shoe performance and prototypes.</p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Outcomes</span></h5>
                        <p>We presented this final dashboard prototype to a group of panelists impersonating the three distinct personas - fashion designer, product manager, and global executive - and received unanimous praise for its ability to prioritize information and focus on salience and relevance over comprehensiveness. All three personas were able to extract the key information they needed from the dashboard, but were also able to better empathize with the needs and perspectives of their peers.</p>
